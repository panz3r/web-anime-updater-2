# Web Anime Updater 2

An updated version of [Web Anime Updater](https://github.com/panz3r/web-anime-updater) project.

## Reasons

Web Anime Updater (WAU) was built using Python and AngularJS with a `monolithic` approach.

WAU2 takes the same base idea but using a more `modular` structure.

## Implementations
A set of various implementation for both the FrontEnd and the BackEnd are envisioned:

### FrontEnd
